## The better VPS - More for Less: Hetzner vs. DigitalOcean

*DigitalOcean has a great offering -- a minimal, intuitive and easy UI and competitive prices. But few know [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=5qVNUejV3pNt), which has not only a cheaper base tier and the same minimal and intuitive UI, but also more powerful servers for the same price. The only real disadvantage: Their locations are limited with servers in Germany, Finland and the United States*

## A comparison of their base tiers
| Metric | Hetzner | DigitalOcean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU Cores | 1 | 1 |
| RAM | 2GB | 1GB |
| Disk Space | 20GB | 25GB |
| Bandwith | **20TB** | **1TB** |
| Company Location (GDPR and data privacy) | EU | US |
| Available Server locations | Europe + US | Around the world |
| Backups | +20% of price | +20% of price |
| One-Click Apps | just 7 | many |
| Storage Expansion Option | yes | yes |
| Green Energy | probably | sometimes |
| Price | **4.15€/m\*** | **5$/m** |

I want to point out a few things here:
- The Hetzner Server has better specs although it costs about half the DigitalOcean one.
- Hetzner includes 20 times more bandwith than DigitalOcean.

There are also a few updates I need to mention as things have changed since I first wrote this post:
- Hetzner increased the price of only their base tier to 4.15€/m due to a shortage of IPv4 addresses. Existing servers are therefore not affected.
- Hetzner added support for 7 One-Click Apps
- I failed to mention the environmental aspect and added this:

Green Energy:
According to Wikipedia, Hetzner uses 100% renewable energy. Though I wasn't able to verify this as the related pages have disappeared from their site (404).
I wasn't able to find information about DigitalOcean, but according to [external sites](https://www.mutual.agency/blog/is-digitalocean-green-hosting/) a few of their data centers run on renewables.

About One-Click Apps, I would argue that:
1. If you can't install software on your server, chances are you will be unable to maintain it
2. There are many resources online on installing almost anything on your server

So I think it's not a big deal that they don't offer them.

## Recommendation
Based on the chart, I think it is obvious that I recommend using Hetzner. [Use my link to get 20€ free server credit to start](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=5qVNUejV3pNt)

*Note: I've been using Hetzner for multiple months now and am very happy with them.  I did not recommend them based on their affiliate payout. (DigitalOcean actually pays out more)*
